description: "Generate or edit raster images through Xiaomi Mify's image gateway using azure_openai/gpt-image-2 when the task benefits from AI-created bitmap visuals such as photos, illustrations, textures, sprites, mockups, or transparent-background cutouts. Use when Codex should create a brand-new image, transform an existing image, derive visual variants from references, or run batch image generation through Mify, and the output should be a bitmap asset rather than repo-native code or vector. Do not use when the task is better handled by the built-in Codex image_gen tool, editing existing SVG/vector/code-native assets, extending an established icon or logo system, or building the visual directly in HTML/CSS/canvas."

# Mify Image Generation Skill

Generates or edits images for the current project through Xiaomi Mify `azure_openai/gpt-image-2` (for example website assets, game assets, UI mockups, product mockups, wireframes, logo design, photorealistic images, or infographics).

## Top-level modes and rules

This skill is a full workflow fork of the official `imagegen` skill, but its default execution path is the Mify image gateway documented in `references/mify-image-api.md`.

This skill has exactly one top-level execution mode:

- **Default Mify CLI mode (preferred):** bundled `scripts/image_gen.py` CLI for normal image generation, editing, batching, and simple transparent-image requests. It calls Mify `http://model.mify.ai.srv/v1/images/generations` and `/images/edits` with `X-Model-Provider-Id: azure_openai` and `model: gpt-image-2`. Requires a Mify token for live calls; `--dry-run` does not.

The CLI exposes three subcommands:

- `generate`
- `edit`
- `generate-batch`

Rules:
- Use the bundled Mify CLI by default for normal image generation and editing requests.
- Do not call the built-in Codex `image_gen` tool from this skill unless the user explicitly asks to leave the Mify path.
- Use Mify `gpt-image-2` for new workflows. Do not silently switch to another model or provider for native transparency or other missing features.
- If the user explicitly asks for a transparent image/background, stay on Mify `gpt-image-2` first: prompt for a flat removable chroma-key background, then remove it locally with the installed helper at `${HOME}/.agents/skills/mify-imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.py`.
- If a transparent request appears too complex for clean chroma-key removal, asks for true/native transparency, or local removal fails validation, explain that this Mify `gpt-image-2` path does not expose native transparent output, then ask before using any different tool or model.
- The word `batch` by itself is enough to use `generate-batch` when many Mify assets are requested and the prompts are distinct or naturally represented as JSONL jobs.
- If the Mify CLI fails because the token is missing, tell the user it requires `MIFY_IMAGE_API_KEY`, `MIFY_API_KEY`, or `~/.config/mify/credentials`. Never ask them to paste the token in chat.
- Use the bundled `scripts/image_gen.py` workflow. Do not create one-off SDK runners.
- Never modify `scripts/image_gen.py` while using the skill for normal image work. If something is missing, ask the user before changing the skill itself.

Mify CLI save-path policy:
- In Mify CLI mode, every generated or edited image is written to the path specified by `--out` or under `--out-dir`.
- Prefer `output/imagegen/` for final artifacts unless the project has a more appropriate asset directory.
- Use `tmp/imagegen/` for intermediate JSONL files, scratch inputs, or chroma-key source images.
- Save-path precedence:
  1. If the user names a destination, write or move the selected output there.
  2. If the image is meant for the current project, write or move the final selected image into the workspace before finishing.
  3. If the image is only for preview or brainstorming, still keep the CLI output in a clear local path and render or reference it inline when useful.
- Never leave a project-referenced asset only in a transient location.
- Do not overwrite an existing asset unless the user explicitly asked for replacement; otherwise create a sibling versioned filename such as `hero-v2.png` or `item-icon-edited.png`.

Shared prompt guidance lives in `references/prompting.md` and `references/sample-prompts.md`.

Mify CLI docs/resources:
- `references/cli.md`
- `references/image-api.md`
- `references/codex-network.md`
- `references/mify-image-api.md`
- `scripts/image_gen.py`

Local post-processing helper:
- `${HOME}/.agents/skills/mify-imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.py`: removes a flat chroma-key background from a generated image and writes a PNG/WebP with alpha. Prefer auto-key sampling, soft matte, and despill for antialiased edges.

## When to use
- Generate a new image (concept art, product shot, cover, website hero)
- Generate a new image using one or more reference images for style, composition, or mood
- Edit an existing image (inpainting, lighting or weather transformations, background replacement, object removal, compositing, transparent background)
- Produce many assets or variants for one task

## When not to use
- Extending or matching an existing SVG/vector icon set, logo system, or illustration library inside the repo
- Creating simple shapes, diagrams, wireframes, or icons that are better produced directly in SVG, HTML/CSS, or canvas
- Making a small project-local asset edit when the source file already exists in an editable native format
- Any task where the user clearly wants deterministic code-native output instead of a generated bitmap

## Decision tree

Think about two separate questions:

1. **Intent:** is this a new image or an edit of an existing image?
2. **Execution strategy:** is this one asset or many assets/variants?

Intent:
- If the user wants to modify an existing image while preserving parts of it, treat the request as **edit**.
- If the user provides images only as references for style, composition, mood, or subject guidance, treat the request as **generate**.
- If the user provides no images, treat the request as **generate**.

Mify edit semantics:
- Mify edit mode is for local image files or image paths that can be encoded as `image_url` data URLs for the Mify edits endpoint.
- If the user provides an attached image or generated image rather than a local path, save or locate it first so it can be passed to `scripts/image_gen.py edit --image <path>`.
- The Mify Feishu sample documents `image_url`; the CLI also accepts `--mask` and sends it as `mask_url` on a best-effort basis.
- For local files, use direct file-path control through the CLI rather than the built-in `image_gen` edit flow.
- For edits, preserve invariants aggressively and save non-destructively by default.

Execution strategy:
- In the Mify CLI path, produce a single asset or variants with `generate` and `--n`.
- For many distinct assets, use separate `generate` calls or the CLI `generate-batch` subcommand.
- For many distinct assets, do not use `n` as a substitute for separate prompts. `n` is for variants of one prompt; distinct assets need distinct Mify calls or distinct CLI `generate-batch` jobs.

Assume the user wants a new image unless they clearly ask to change an existing one.

## Workflow
1. Use the default Mify CLI mode, including simple transparent-output requests via chroma-key generation plus local removal.
2. Decide the intent: `generate` or `edit`.
3. Decide whether the output is preview-only or meant to be consumed by the current project.
4. Decide the execution strategy: single asset vs repeated built-in calls vs CLI `generate-batch`.
5. Collect inputs up front: prompt(s), exact text (verbatim), constraints/avoid list, and any input images.
6. For every input image, label its role explicitly:
   - reference image
   - edit target
   - supporting insert/style/compositing input
7. If the edit target is only visible in conversation context and not on the local filesystem, save or locate it before calling the Mify CLI edit path.
8. If the user asked for a photo, illustration, sprite, product image, banner, or other explicitly raster-style asset, use the Mify image CLI rather than substituting SVG/HTML/CSS placeholders. If the request is for an icon, logo, or UI graphic that should match existing repo-native SVG/vector/code assets, prefer editing those directly instead.
9. Augment the prompt based on specificity:
   - If the user's prompt is already specific and detailed, normalize it into a clear spec without adding creative requirements.
   - If the user's prompt is generic, add tasteful augmentation only when it materially improves output quality.
10. Use `scripts/image_gen.py` by default.
11. For transparent-output requests, follow the transparent image guidance below: generate with Mify `gpt-image-2` on a flat chroma-key background, write the selected output into the workspace or `tmp/imagegen/`, run the installed `${HOME}/.agents/skills/mify-imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.py` helper, and validate the alpha result before using it. If this path looks unsuitable or fails, ask before switching to any different tool or model.
12. Inspect outputs and validate: subject, style, composition, text accuracy, and invariants/avoid items.
13. Iterate with a single targeted change, then re-check.
14. For preview-only work, render or reference the image inline; the underlying file should remain in a clear CLI output path.
15. For project-bound work, write, move, or copy the selected artifact into the workspace and update any consuming code or references. Never leave a project-referenced asset only in a transient location.
16. For batches or multi-asset requests, persist every requested deliverable final in the workspace unless the user explicitly asked to keep outputs preview-only. Discarded variants do not need to be kept unless requested.
17. Use the Mify CLI docs for model, quality, size, masks, output format, output paths, token, and network setup.
18. Always report the final saved path(s) for any workspace-bound asset(s), plus the final prompt or prompt set and that Mify `azure_openai/gpt-image-2` was used.

## Transparent image requests

Transparent-image requests still use Mify `gpt-image-2` first. Because this documented Mify path does not expose a true transparent-background control, create a removable chroma-key source image and then convert the key color to alpha locally.

Default sequence:
1. Use Mify `gpt-image-2` to generate the requested subject on a perfectly flat solid chroma-key background.
2. Choose a key color that is unlikely to appear in the subject: default `#00ff00`, use `#ff00ff` for green subjects, and avoid `#0000ff` for blue subjects.
3. After generation, write or move the selected source image into the workspace or `tmp/imagegen/`.
4. Run the installed helper path, not a project-relative script path:
   ```bash
   python "${HOME}/.agents/skills/mify-imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.py" \
     --input <source> \
     --out <final.png> \
     --auto-key border \
     --soft-matte \
     --transparent-threshold 12 \
     --opaque-threshold 220 \
     --despill
   ```
5. Validate that the output has an alpha channel, transparent corners, plausible subject coverage, and no obvious key-color fringe. If a thin fringe remains, retry once with `--edge-contract 1`; use `--edge-feather 0.25` only when the edge is visibly stair-stepped and the subject is not shiny or reflective.
6. Save the final alpha PNG/WebP in the project if the asset is project-bound. Never leave a project-referenced transparent asset only in a transient location.

Prompt transparent requests like this:

```text
Create the requested subject on a perfectly flat solid #00ff00 chroma-key background for background removal.
The background must be one uniform color with no shadows, gradients, texture, reflections, floor plane, or lighting variation.
Keep the subject fully separated from the background with crisp edges and generous padding.
Do not use #00ff00 anywhere in the subject.
No cast shadow, no contact shadow, no reflection, no watermark, and no text unless explicitly requested.
```

Do not automatically switch to any non-Mify tool or non-`gpt-image-2` model instead of chroma keying. Ask the user first when the user asks for true/native transparency, when local removal fails validation, or when the requested image is complex: hair, fur, feathers, smoke, glass, liquids, translucent materials, reflective objects, soft shadows, realistic product grounding, or subject colors that conflict with all practical key colors.

Use a concise confirmation like:

```text
This likely needs true native transparency. The Mify gpt-image-2 path uses a chroma-key background plus local removal, and the documented Mify image-2 endpoint does not expose background=transparent. Should I use a different tool or model for true transparency?
```

## Prompt augmentation

Reformat user prompts into a structured, production-oriented spec. Make the user's goal clearer and more actionable, but do not blindly add detail.

Treat this as prompt-shaping guidance, not a closed schema. Use only the lines that help, and add a short extra labeled line when it materially improves clarity.

### Specificity policy

Use the user's prompt specificity to decide how much augmentation is appropriate:

- If the prompt is already specific and detailed, preserve that specificity and only normalize/structure it.
- If the prompt is generic, you may add tasteful augmentation when it will materially improve the result.

Allowed augmentations:
- composition or framing hints
- polish level or intended-use hints
- practical layout guidance
- reasonable scene concreteness that supports the stated request

Not allowed augmentations:
- extra characters or objects that are not implied by the request
- brand names, slogans, palettes, or narrative beats that are not implied
- arbitrary side-specific placement unless the surrounding layout supports it

## Use-case taxonomy (exact slugs)

Classify each request into one of these buckets and keep the slug consistent across prompts and references.

Generate:
- photorealistic-natural — candid/editorial lifestyle scenes with real texture and natural lighting.
- product-mockup — product/packaging shots, catalog imagery, merch concepts.
- ui-mockup — app/web interface mockups and wireframes; specify the desired fidelity.
- infographic-diagram — diagrams/infographics with structured layout and text.
- scientific-educational — classroom explainers, scientific diagrams, and learning visuals with required labels and accuracy constraints.
- ads-marketing — campaign concepts and ad creatives with audience, brand position, scene, and exact tagline/copy.
- productivity-visual — slide, chart, workflow, and data-heavy business visuals.
- logo-brand — logo/mark exploration, vector-friendly.
- illustration-story — comics, children’s book art, narrative scenes.
- stylized-concept — style-driven concept art, 3D/stylized renders.
- historical-scene — period-accurate/world-knowledge scenes.

Edit:
- text-localization — translate/replace in-image text, preserve layout.
- identity-preserve — try-on, person-in-scene; lock face/body/pose.
- precise-object-edit — remove/replace a specific element (including interior swaps).
- lighting-weather — time-of-day/season/atmosphere changes only.
- background-extraction — transparent background / clean cutout. Use Mify `gpt-image-2` with chroma-key removal first for simple opaque subjects; ask before using a different tool or model for complex native transparency.
- style-transfer — apply reference style while changing subject/scene.
- compositing — multi-image insert/merge with matched lighting/perspective.
- sketch-to-render — drawing/line art to photoreal render.

## Shared prompt schema

Use the following labeled spec as shared prompt scaffolding for both top-level modes:

```text
Use case: <taxonomy slug>
Asset type: <where the asset will be used>
Primary request: <user's main prompt>
Input images: <Image 1: role; Image 2: role> (optional)
Scene/backdrop: <environment>
Subject: <main subject>
Style/medium: <photo/illustration/3D/etc>
Composition/framing: <wide/close/top-down; placement>
Lighting/mood: <lighting + mood>
Color palette: <palette notes>
Materials/textures: <surface details>
Text (verbatim): "<exact text>"
Constraints: <must keep/must avoid>
Avoid: <negative constraints>
```

Notes:
- `Asset type` and `Input images` are prompt scaffolding, not dedicated CLI flags.
- `Scene/backdrop` refers to the visual setting. It is not the same as the Mify CLI `background` parameter, which controls output background behavior.
- Mify execution notes such as `Quality:`, masks, output format, and output paths belong in the CLI path only. Do not treat them as built-in `image_gen` tool arguments.

Augmentation rules:
- Keep it short.
- Add only the details needed to improve the prompt materially.
- For edits, explicitly list invariants (`change only X; keep Y unchanged`).
- If any critical detail is missing and blocks success, ask a question; otherwise proceed.

## Examples

### Generation example (hero image)
```text
Use case: product-mockup
Asset type: landing page hero
Primary request: a minimal hero image of a ceramic coffee mug
Style/medium: clean product photography
Composition/framing: wide composition with usable negative space for page copy if needed
Lighting/mood: soft studio lighting
Constraints: no logos, no text, no watermark
```

### Edit example (invariants)
```text
Use case: precise-object-edit
Asset type: product photo background replacement
Primary request: replace only the background with a warm sunset gradient
Constraints: change only the background; keep the product and its edges unchanged; no text; no watermark
```

## Prompting best practices
- Structure prompt as scene/backdrop -> subject -> details -> constraints.
- Include intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set the mode and polish level.
- Use camera/composition language for photorealism.
- Only use SVG/vector stand-ins when the user explicitly asked for vector output or a non-image placeholder.
- Quote exact text and specify typography + placement.
- For tricky words, spell them letter-by-letter and require verbatim rendering.
- For multi-image inputs, reference images by index and describe how they should be used.
- For edits, repeat invariants every iteration to reduce drift.
- Iterate with single-change follow-ups.
- If the prompt is generic, add only the extra detail that will materially help.
- If the prompt is already detailed, normalize it instead of expanding it.
- For Mify CLI execution, see `references/cli.md` and `references/image-api.md` for model, `quality`, masks, output format, and output-path guidance.
- For transparent images, use the Mify-first chroma-key workflow unless the request is complex enough to need true native transparency; ask before switching to any different tool or model.

Copy/paste specs shared by both modes: `references/sample-prompts.md`.

## Guidance by asset type
Asset-type templates (website assets, game assets, wireframes, logo) are consolidated in `references/sample-prompts.md`.

## gpt-image-2 guidance for Mify CLI

The Mify CLI defaults to `gpt-image-2`.

- Use Mify `gpt-image-2` for new CLI/API workflows unless the user explicitly asks to leave the Mify path.
- If a transparent request may need a non-Mify fallback, ask first. Explain that the Mify chroma-key path is the default, and the documented Mify `gpt-image-2` endpoint does not expose native `background=transparent`.
- `gpt-image-2` always uses high fidelity for image inputs; do not set `input_fidelity` with this model.
- `gpt-image-2` supports `quality` values `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `auto`.
- Use `quality low` for fast drafts, thumbnails, and quick iterations. Use `medium`, `high`, or `auto` for final assets, dense text, diagrams, identity-sensitive edits, or high-resolution outputs.
- Square images are typically fastest to generate. Use `1024x1024` for fast square drafts.
- If the user asks for 4K-style output, use `3840x2160` for landscape or `2160x3840` for portrait.
- `gpt-image-2` size may be `auto` or `WIDTHxHEIGHT` if all constraints hold: max edge `<= 3840px`, both edges multiples of `16px`, long-to-short ratio `<= 3:1`, total pixels between `655,360` and `8,294,400`.

Popular `gpt-image-2` sizes:
- `1024x1024` square
- `1536x1024` landscape
- `1024x1536` portrait
- `2048x2048` 2K square
- `2048x1152` 2K landscape
- `3840x2160` 4K landscape
- `2160x3840` 4K portrait
- `auto`

## Mify CLI mode only

### Temp and output conventions
These conventions apply to the Mify CLI path. They do not describe built-in `image_gen` output behavior.
- Use `tmp/imagegen/` for intermediate files (for example JSONL batches); delete them when done.
- Write final artifacts under `output/imagegen/`.
- Use `--out` or `--out-dir` to control output paths; keep filenames stable and descriptive.

### Dependencies
Prefer `uv` for dependency management in this repo.

Required for local chroma-key removal and optional downscaling:
```bash
uv pip install pillow
```

Portability note:
- If you are using the installed skill outside this repo, install dependencies into that environment with its package manager.
- In uv-managed environments, `uv pip install ...` remains the preferred path.

### Environment
- `MIFY_IMAGE_API_KEY`, `MIFY_API_KEY`, or `~/.config/mify/credentials` must be available for live API calls.
- `scripts/image_gen.py` uses stdlib HTTP and does not require the OpenAI Python SDK.
- Never ask the user to paste the full key in chat. Ask them to set it locally and confirm when ready.

If the key is missing, give the user these steps:
1. Configure the Mify token with the existing `mify-model-gateway` token setup flow, or set `MIFY_API_KEY` locally.
2. Prefer `~/.config/mify/credentials` with `export MIFY_API_KEY=...` and `chmod 600`.
3. Open a new terminal or source the credentials file.

If installation is not possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it into their active environment.
